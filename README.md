# SamBa-GQW

This repository contains the code and examples of use of [Sampled-Based Guided Quantum Walk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15138) (SamBa-GQW). We provide a notebook for each problem investigated in the paper: MaxCut, MIS, Portfolio optimization, LABS, TSP and Max-k-SAT.

The necessary libraries and their versions for our simulations are listed in `requirements.txt`.
